# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Resampling-Techniques

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning algorithms and resampling techniques. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions and minimize financial losses for both consumers and financial institutions.

# Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant problem affecting consumers and businesses worldwide. Traditional methods of fraud detection often struggle to keep up with evolving fraudulent techniques. Machine learning offers a promising solution by leveraging historical transaction data to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.

# Key Features
Utilized four machine learning algorithms for fraud detection:
  Logistic Regression
  Random Forest
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  KNN

# Implemented four resampling techniques to address class imbalance:

  SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
  Random Under-sampling
  Tomek Links
  Near Miss
